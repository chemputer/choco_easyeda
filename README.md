Chocolatey Repository for EasyEDA Desktop package

### This is now archived, I no longer have the time to maintain this package. If you'd like to (or can setup an automatic method, I can't figure them out, me dumb dumb I know.)
then PLEASE, feel free. I posted a comment on [the chocolatey maintainer page for EasyEDA](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/easyeda) so that should expedite any requests to take over the project.
